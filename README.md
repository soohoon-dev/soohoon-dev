### Hi there, I'm Soohoon 👋

**Technical Performance Marketing Lead | Data-Driven Growth & Measurement**

I bridge the gap between **Business Strategy** and **Data Engineering**.
With a background in **Architecture (M.Arch)** and **10 years as a Founder/Director**, I don't just look at numbers—I design the *structure* for growth.
