### Hi there, I'm Soohoon 👋

**Technical Performance Marketing Lead | Paid Media + Measurement (GA4/GTM)**

I bridge the gap between **performance marketing** and **reliable measurement**.
With a background in **Architecture (M.Arch)** and **10+ years as a Founder**, I don’t just run campaigns—I design the *structure* that makes growth measurable.

### 🚀 Who I Am
* **Business-Minded:** 10+ years of experience running a business (Founder). I understand ROI-focused execution.
* **Design-Thinking:** M.Arch graduate. I apply architectural thinking to design clear measurement plans and user funnels.
* **Technical Marketer:** I connect paid media execution with tracking and reporting—so optimization decisions are based on clean data, not guesswork.
